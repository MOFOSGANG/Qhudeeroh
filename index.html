                    <h3>Your Weird, Expressive Nature</h3>
                    <p>You're weird in the most beautiful way. You don't fit the mold, and frankly? You shattered it.
                        Your expressiveness is magnetic, the way you move through the world authentically, without
                        apology, without filter. You give people permission to be themselves just by being
                        unapologetically YOU. That's a gift.</p>

                    <span class="card-emoji">❤️</span>
                    <h3>Your Emotional Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>Your humor comes from a place of truth. You laugh at the absurd because you SEE the absurd. Your
                        credit alert celebrations, your unfiltered conversations with people you love... these moments
                        reveal someone who knows how to find joy in realness. You make people feel SAFE being
                        themselves. That's rare. That's everything.</p>

                    <span class="card-emoji">🧸</span>
                    <h3>Your Passions & Self-Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>You know what feeds your soul: sleep that feels like meditation, food that tastes like love,
                        drawing that lets your heart speak. You don't apologize for prioritizing what makes you feel
                        alive. That's not laziness or indulgence, that's SELF RESPECT. That's wisdom. You understand
                        that life isn't about doing more; it's about FEELING more.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="appreciation-card" data-delay="3">
                    <span class="card-emoji">💕</span>
                    <h3>Your Emotional Depth & Strength</h3>
                    <p>Your capacity to love deeply and communicate honestly is your superpower. You've grown into
                        yourself with intention. You've accepted your identity, all of it. That journey? That took
                        courage. Your softness isn't weakness; it's your strength. Your vulnerability is your power.
                        You're soft AND confident. That's the perfect balance.</p>

                        resets. You know the power of rest, and you honor it. That's wisdom in a world obsessed with

                        taste life. You savor it. The way you find pleasure in the simple act of eating well? That's

                    <p>Your art is your soul's language. When words fail, your drawings speak. Every line, every sketch,
                        every creation is a piece of your heart on paper. You're not just drawing; you're communicating.
                        You're expressing what lives inside. That's profound.</p>

                        choose truth. You choose genuine conversations. You choose to show up as YOU. That takes more

                <div class="letter-content">
                    <p>There's something about the way you move through the world that's magnetic. You don't try to be
                        anyone else. You can't, and I'm grateful for that.</p>

                    <p>Your weirdness is your magic. The way you think, the way you see the world, the things that make
                        you laugh at 3 AM... that's what makes you irreplaceable. Never soften that. Never apologize for
                        it.</p>

                    <p>I see your softness, and I see your strength coexisting in perfect balance. You're not too much.
                        You're exactly enough. Your expressiveness isn't overwhelming; it's healing. The way you
                        communicate honestly, the way you love without holding back... people feel SAFE around you
                        because you're safe with yourself.</p>

                    <p>You get fed up easily? Good. That means you have standards. You know your worth. You're selective
                        about your energy. That's not a flaw; that's self respect.</p>

                    <p>Your emotional growth has been beautiful to witness. The way you've accepted your identity, all
                        the parts of you... soft, expressive, creative, deep... shows a courage most people will never
                        have. You're not just surviving; you're thriving.</p>

                    <p><em>Keep sleeping when you need to.</em> Sleep isn't laziness; it's meditation.<br>
                        <em>Keep eating the good food.</em> Food is joy when you eat it with intention.<br>
                        <em>Keep drawing. Keep creating.</em> Keep expressing what lives in your heart.<br>
                        <em>Keep being weird. Keep being expressive.</em> Keep being YOU.

                <p>When you walk into a room, things shift. People relax. Conversations become real. That's because
                    you've decided authenticity matters more than comfort.</p>

                <p>Your vibe is cozy intimacy mixed with quiet confidence. You're trendy but timeless. You're soft but
                    grounded. You're expressive but thoughtful. That balance is rare.</p>

                <p>You laugh at things that don't make sense because you understand that life is beautifully absurd. You
                    celebrate the small wins because you know joy is in the details. You prioritize sleep, good food,
                    and art because you understand that taking care of your soul is just as important as anything else.
                </p>

                <p>The people you let close know the real you. Unfiltered. Honest. Beautiful in your complexity. That's
